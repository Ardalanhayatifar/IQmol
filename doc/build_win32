                   =======================================
  				    Building IQmol From Source on Windows
                   =======================================

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Most of the work required in compiling IQmol is setting up the required
libraries.  The compilation of the code should be relatively straightforward.

 o Download the Qt libraries from http://www.qt.io
   The latest version tested is 5.x.x.  Qt provides a command prompt that sets
   up the required environment (path, etc).  All compilation (unless otherwise
   stated) should be performed in one of these prompts to ensure a native
   Windows binary is  produced without any linking to cygwin libraries.

 o Ensure gfortran is installed, installer packages can be found at
   https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries

 o Cmake will be required to compile some of the libraries, the installer can
   be obtained from http://www.cmake.org/download/

 o Make sure the zlib and libxml2 MinGW libraries have been installed.


 o OpenSSL:
   - Download: https://www.openssl.org/source  (version 1.0.1p)
   - Compile:  all in a cygwin prompt

      ./Configure --prefix=../extlibs2 no-idea no-mdc2 no-rc5 mingw
      make depend
      make


 o LibSSH2:
   - Download: http://www.libssh2.org  (version 1.6.0)
   - Compile: 

      ./configure --with-openssl --with-libssl-prefix=../openssl-1.0.1g --without-libgcrypt --with-libz


 o Boost:
   - Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.56.0/
     Later versions of boost seem to have removed the load_collection function which
     is part of the serialization routines.
   - Compile: 


 o OpenMesh:
   - Download: http://www.openmesh.org/download/ 
   - Compile:
    
 o QGLViewer:
   - Download: http://libqglviewer.com/download.html
   - Complie:


 o OpenBabel:
   - Download: http://openbabel.org/wiki/Get_Open_Babel (2.3.1)

   - Compilation:  The OpenBabel libraries are difficult to compile using
     MinGW.  I was unable to get the plugins working and so had to compile
	 these directly into the executable.  The IQmol.pro file takes care of the
	 inclusion of the required files.   

       cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=/include -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/lib/libz.a -DLIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR=/include -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=/lib/libxml2.a
       mingw32-make




Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

 o Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main
      mingw32-gfortran -c symmol.f90

 o Compile the remaining IQmol source
      qmake IQmol.pro
      make



Other
~~~~~
 o Distribution Version: Windows
   - Copy the Openbable directory containging the plugin source into the
     IQmol/src directory.  IQmol.pro includes this for Windows and is required
	 because I can't get the plugins compiled properly.
   - Copy the symmol.o file from a previous build into src.  I have no idea how
     I compiled this now.
   - run qmake -win32 -o Makefile IQmol.pro
   - make
   - If memory is exhausted, debugging symbols can be stripped using strip -g lib*.a
   - for some reason common.pri needs to be added to IQmol/IQmol.pro after the libraries
