                   =======================================
  				    Building IQmol From Source on Windows
                   =======================================

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Most of the work required in compiling IQmol is setting up the required
libraries.  The compilation of the code should be relatively straightforward.

 o Download the Qt libraries from http://www.qt.io
   The latest version tested is 5.x.x.  Qt provides a command prompt that sets
   up the required environment (path, etc).  All compilation (unless otherwise
   stated) should be performed in one of these prompts to ensure a native
   Windows binary is  produced without any linking to cygwin libraries.

 o Ensure gfortran is installed, installer packages can be found at
   https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries

 o Cmake will be required to compile some of the libraries, the installer can
   be obtained from http://www.cmake.org/download/

 o The MinGW/MSYS environment needs to be set up. See 

           http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

   for details on how to download the installer and install the developement
   environemnt.

 o I followed the instructions on http://gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw_how_to.html
   to install libz, libxml2 and openssl.  The relevant libraries should be installed
   in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\lib

 o LibSSH2:
   - Download: http://www.libssh2.org  (version 1.6.0)
   - Compile (inside C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe):

      ./configure --with-openssl --with-libssl-prefix=/usr/local/
         --without-libgcrypt --with-libz --with-libz-prefix=/usr/local

      make 
      make install

   - Note that PATH was set set as:

       export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/CMake/bin:/c/MingGW/bin:/usr/bin


 o OpenBabel:
   - Download: http://openbabel.org/wiki/Get_Open_Babel (2.3.1)

   - I compiled the libraries within the bash.exe shell, but Cmake complained
     that sh.exe was on the path.  Simply resetting the PATH before running
     the cmake command seemed to work:

       export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/CMake/bin:/c/MinGW/bin

       cmake ../ -G "MinGW Makefiles" 
        -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libz.a 
        -DLIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libxml2.a
        -DBUILD_SHARED=OFF

     this presupposes the libxml2 and libz libraries are in C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/local/lib 
     which is mapped to /usr/local/lib, go figure.  Compile with mingw32-make:
     
        mingw32-make

 o QGLViewer:  
   - Download: http://libqglviewer.com/download.html
   - Compile (inside C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe):

      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake ../ -G "MinGW Makefiles"
      mingw32-make

   - Note that /usr/bin needs to be removed from PATH as above


 o OpenMesh:
   - Download: http://www.openmesh.org/download/ 
   - Complie (within the Qt command prompt):
   - Compile:
    
 o Boost:
   - Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.56.0/
     Later versions of boost seem to have removed the load_collection function which
     is part of the serialization routines and there are reports of problems with the
     build for MinGW
   - Compile (inside the Qt cmd prompt): 

       bootstrap.bat mingw
       .\b2 toolset=gcc 



Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

 o Use the cmd.exe prompt to compile symmol.o, maybe setting the path first
   path %PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin

 o Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main
      mingw32-gfortran -c symmol.f90

 o Compile the remaining IQmol source
      qmake IQmol.pro
      make



Other
~~~~~
 o Distribution Version: Windows
   - Copy the Openbable directory containging the plugin source into the
     IQmol/src directory.  IQmol.pro includes this for Windows and is required
	 because I can't get the plugins compiled properly.
   - Copy the symmol.o file from a previous build into src.  I have no idea how
     I compiled this now.
   - run qmake -win32 -o Makefile IQmol.pro
   - make
   - If memory is exhausted, debugging symbols can be stripped using strip -g lib*.a
   - for some reason common.pri needs to be added to IQmol/IQmol.pro after the libraries
