                     ====================================
					  Building IQmol From Source on OS X
                     ====================================

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Most of the work required in compiling IQmol is setting up the required
libraries.  The compilation of the code should be relatively straightforward.

 o Download the Qt libraries from http://www.qt.io
   The latest version tested is 5.5.0.  Ensure that the bin directory
   containing qmake is added to your PATH, the default location for this is
   /Applications/Qt5.5.0/5.5/clang_64/bin

 o Ensure gfortran is installed, installer packages can be found at
   https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS

 o Cmake will be required to compile some of the libraries, the installer can
   be obtained from http://www.cmake.org/download/



 o OpenSSL:
   - Download: https://www.openssl.org/source  (version 1.0.1p)
   - Compile:  The regular compilation does not compile x86 code, so we envoke
     Configure manually:

        ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc
        make

   - Static libraries appear in top directory


 o LibSSH2:
   - Download: http://www.libssh2.org  (version 1.6.0)
   - Compile: 

        ./configure --with-openssl --with-libssl-prefix=$DEV/openssl-1.0.1p --with-libz
        make

   - Shared and static libraries located in src/.libs


 o Boost:
   - Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.56.0/
     Later versions of boost seem to have removed the load_collection function which
     is part of the serialization routines.
   - Compile: needs the -stdlib=libstdc++ setting to be compatible with Qt.
     Further details at:
     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20108407/how-do-i-compile-boost-for-os-x-64b-platforms-with-stdlibc

        ./bootstrap.sh --prefix= toolset=clang
        ./b2 toolset=clang --without-mpi cxxflags="-arch x86_64 -fvisibility=hidden \
             -fvisibility-inlines-hidden -stdlib=libstdc++ -ftemplate-depth=512" \
             linkflags="-stdlib=libstdc++" stage

   - Static libraries are in stage/lib.  If they do not appear you may need to
     add "link=static runtime-link=static" to the b2 arguments


 o OpenMesh:
   - Download: http://www.openmesh.org/download/ 
   - Compile: by default OpenMesh links to libc++ which is incompatibile with Qt.
     Add the following lines near the top of the CMakeLists.txt file:

        add_compile_options(-stdlib=libstdc++)
        set( CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-stdlib=libstdc++" )
        set( CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "-stdlib=libstdc++" )
        set( CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS "-stdlib=libstdc++" )
        set( CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-stdlib=libstdc++" )
    
     Then compiled using cmake:

        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../
        make

   - Shared and static libraries located in build/Build/lib


 o QGLViewer:
   - Download: http://libqglviewer.com/download.html
   - Complie:
        qmake QGLVIEWER_STATIC=yes
        make

   - Static library appears in QGLViewer


 o OpenBabel:
   - Download: http://openbabel.org/wiki/Get_Open_Babel (2.3.1)
     Use the installer which puts things in the following locations:
     Headers: /usr/local/include/openbabel-2.0
     PlugIns: /usr/local/lib/openbable/2.3.1
     Libs:    /usr/local/lib



Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

 o Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main
      gfortran -c symmol.f90

 o Compile the remaining IQmol source
      qmake IQmol.pro
      make



Other
~~~~~
 o In order to get the command line tools installed you need to:
     xcode-select --install
