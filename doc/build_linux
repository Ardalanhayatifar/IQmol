                     =====================================
                      Building IQmol From Source on Linux
                     =====================================

These steps were used to compile under Ubuntu 13.04

1) Insure the necessary utilities and libraries are installed:

     apt-get install git
     apt-get install cmake
     apt-get install gfortran
     apt-get install libssl-dev
     apt-get install libboost-dev


2) Download the Qt libraries from www.qt.io

   Note that Qt5 libraries are required and most distributions only have Qt4
   packages so you cannot use apt-get.  The download (~600Mb) seems to be very
   slow and it is recommended that an appropriate mirror is used.  Be sure to 
   add the Qt bin directory to your path, using bash this can be accomplished
   by adding something similar to the following to ~/.bashrc:

      if [ -d "$DEV/Qt5.5.0/5.5/gcc_64/bin" ] ; then
         PATH="$DEV/Qt5.5.0/5.5/gcc_64/bin:$PATH"
      fi

   Note that $DEV should be set to the directory containing the Qt installation


3) Download the OpenMesh source from www.openmesh.org

   The latest version tested is version 3.3 but I needed to specify the C++
   compiler by adding the following line to the CMakeLists.txt file:

     set (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "g++-4.4")

   Compile using cmake (both static and shared libraries are written to the
   build/Build/lib directory):

        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../
        make


4) Download the OpenBabel source from www.openbable.org

   The latest version of the source is 2.3.2.  As with OpenMesh, I needed to
   specify the compier as g++-4.4.  Compile using cmake, libraries appear in 
   the lib directory.

        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../
        make

   I copied the babelconfig.h file from build/include to include/openbabel.


5) Download the LibSSH2 source from www.libssh2.org

   The latest version tested is 1.6.  Compilation is straightforward and
   results in shared and static libraries located in src/.libs

        ./configure --with-openssl --with-libz
        make


6) Download the OpenSSL source from www.openssl.org

        ./config
         make


7) Download the QGLViewer source from libqglviewer.com and compile using qmake

        qmake QGLVIEWER_STATIC=yes QGLViewer.pro
        make


8) Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main
   There is one Fortran source file that must be compiled using gfortran.  I haven't 
   worked out how to get Qt to do this in the .pro file:

       gfortran -c symmol.f90


9) Compile IQmol  
   You may need to edit the IQmol/src/common.pri file to reflect the locations
   of the various installed packages.  I put all the compiled libraries above
   in the $DEV directory which I specify in .bashrc

       qmake IQmol.pro
       make
