TODO LIST:
~~~~~~~~~~
 - Samples for the Parser/test directory:
    - iqmol archive
    - charges file
    - esp/hf/mo plot files from QChem

 - clean up MoleculeLayer class
 - For the geometry configurator, a context menu should allow the user to
   export the coordinates to a file.  (This can be done with copy and paste)
 - Normalize light directions in shaders
 - Check frequency intensities
 - JobMonitor should be started when IQmol starts
 - Test Kill command
 - Network
    - need to test public key, hostbased and agent authentication for SshConnection
    - Test queuing of requests on SSH channel
    - Block further updates if one is active



THINGS TO CONSIDER:
  - CubeDataLayer currently duplicates the grid data, which is a wasteful
  - Concept of an engine, these would correspond to threaded tasks that require
    some computational overhead
  - Surface visibility and orientation needs to be archived
  - Texture mapping for meshes
  - Vertex normals could be re-evaluated after decimation to improve lighting(?)
  - Geometric parameters should be able to be set without having to be constrained
  - Surface generatation/decimation should all be threaded
  - User of depth buffer for fog to give depth perception
  - Shell::evaluate should probably take doubles rather than Vec to save calling the ctor
  - Batch processing
  - JobMonitor list saved too often




IQmol 2.7 
~~~~~~~~~

 o File Formats
    - Molden input format (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/molden_format.html)
    - Archive file
    - Samples for the Parser/test directory:
       - iqmol archive
       - charges file
       - esp/hf/mo plot files from QChem

 o Spectra:
    - UV and examination of excited states
       - Spin flip/MOM
    - NMR (including spin-spin coupling)
       - Need data base of nmr shifts for TMS
       - Set reference

 o Symmetry module:
    - Display of symmetry elements (transparent planes)
    - Animation of symmetry operations.

           - Symmetry item (configurator is PG table)
              - rotation
              - reflection
    

 o CactusServer for naming molecules
     -  http://www.chemspider.com

 o Sundry:
    - Test public key, hostbased and agent authentication for SshConnection
    - Copy progress needs reporting in the JobMonitor
    - The JobMonitor should be started after the splash screen has been showed as
      if there are old jobs running then the dialog box is obscured.
    - JobMonitor list saved too often
	- Sort out the compilation order so that there are no cross dependencies
	  for IQmol libaries
    - Fix display of atom labels in Qt 5.0
    - Ability to print 2D plots (spectra etc.)
    - Surface visibility and orientation needs to be archived
    - CubeDataLayer currently duplicates the grid data, which is a wasteful



IQmol 3.0
~~~~~~~~~

 * Atom Properties
    o Generalize for things like NMR shifts, isotopes etc.
    o Atom configurator should allow setting isotope, convert to charge

 * Grid Data class
    o Allow for upsampling
    o Incorporate Lebedev grids
    o Allow for gradients

 * QUI
    o When reading in Q-Chem input/output, we should remember the rem settings
       - These could be added to the File layer.
    o Isotopic substitution passed through
    o For plots, (eg. ESP) generate suggested box boundaries.

 * Viewer
    o Clipping planes - a new global object (mouse grabber)
       - Display property (eg. ESP)
       - Configure color, transparency, size, border
    o Adjustable resolution for large systems.
    o Surface data needs progress bar even SAD densities
    o Visual Enhancements
       - Ambient occlusion based on vdW spheres or using an highly decimated mesh
       - User of depth buffer for fog to give depth perception
       - Customize background: 
           http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5006317/how-to-draw-background-in-opengl

 * Builder:
    o Concept of the active molecule
       - only active molecule can be selected in build mode
       - frozen
       - only activate build mode if there is one visible molecule (?)
       - use modify icon to indicate the active molecule
       - context menu can allow selection for modification
       - prompt user if molecule is locked
       - new molecule automatically becomes the active one
    o Unfreezing a molecule invalidates the following:
       - Symmetry Elements
       - Files
       - Frequencies
       - Surfaces
       - Conformers
       - pretty much everything
    o Conformer searching
    o Lock molecules so they can't be edited (via builder)
       - Under what conditions should this be done?
       - if there is a data file attached (.out, .fchk .cube)
       - any read from file
       - symmetry percieved
    o Copy, paste, cut
    o New molecule from selection (could just be copy and paste into new)
    o Merge molecules
       - only requires primitives to be copied, most other layers become invalid
       - selected || visible
       - how to handle differences in settings, e.g. tubes or CPK
    o Configure selected atoms
       - set basis set
       - convert to charges
    o Align molecules (RMS)

    o Improved selection

 * Fragments
   o Sub components of a molecule, care needs to be taken not to duplicate the
     Molecule functionality (e.g. visibility).
   o Functionality:
     - freeze
     - group, ungroup
     - movement via mouse grabber
     - undo movement (rotation, translation)
     - convert to EFP and back (charges)
   o Requires the list of GLObjects not be flattened by the ViewerModel so that
     the frame heirarchy is accounted for
     Molecule.draw() -> Fragment.draw() -> Primitives.draw()  { loops over }
  o If molecule has a frame, then this can be pushed before drawing surfaces.  Thus
    after the molecule is frozen surfaces can be transformed

  1) Fragment is a layer with a list of GLObjects to draw and a ManipulatedFrame
     We would like it to behave like a primitive.  
     Viewer draw with names should treat it like a primitive
     Molecule should have a frame push befor drawing, this would fix surfaces movement

      - selection needs to select entire fragment
      - ungroup fragments
      - test nested fragments

 * Layers:
   o Bond lengths, angles and torsions
   o Surfaces
     - Solvent excluded surface
     - Implementation of shaders
   o Gradient fields
     - density gradient (?)
     - ESP gradient
   o Custom coloring of Atoms 
     - molecule (for alignment)
     - chemical shift
     - spin density
     - distance (?) from center and an atom
     - configurator should be a spreadsheet with properties
     - basis
   o Editing multiple Layers of the same type at once

   o Configure Atom/Bond should allow individual Draw Modes to be altered
     - basis set, convert to charge
     - atom configrator should configure a list of atoms
   o Layers should return a list of actions that can be performed for context menu
     - Molecule: delete, freeze, unfreeze, to fragments new molecule from selection
     - Fragment:
   o More layers need tool tips

 * Orbitals
   - localization
   - symmetry

 * Session:
   o Serialization of 
     - Surfaces
     - Molecule settings (atom diameters etc)
   o DnD support for several data files for the one molecule

 * Data Display
   o 2D plotting functionality
     - Raw data dump for 3rd party plotting applications
   o Spectra
     - NMR \
     - IR   > These need an id tag to show where they come from (ab initio, approx) tooltip?
     - UV  /
   o Molecule properties

 * Labels
   o NMR shifts
   o Basis

 * Parser
   o Each parser should produce as much information as possible, DataList should be
     smartened up to determine which parser has the more reliable information.

 * Movies
   o Optimization pathways
   o Vibrational frequencies
   o Orbital morphing
   o Structure morphing
   o Seqences
     - multiple sequences may include optimization pathway and then a
       linear interpolation to a final structure

 * Features
   o DMA calculation (from fchk file)
   o lebedev grids (integration, ISA)
   o Compute transition densities from CIS amplitudes
     - Koopman densities

 * Export
   o Data for gnuplot?
   o POVray
   o better support for images
     - no background => transparent
   o proprietary format (save session)

 * Misc
   o add value label for transparency for surface configurator
   o Better cutoffs for evaluation
     - Editing bounding box
     - Cube subdivision

 * GL2PS
  - Export as pdf, eps etc
    New QFileDialog that gets the name and format:
        if (vector) {
           use gl2ps
        }else {
           replicate the QGLViewer functionality
        }

Parallels black screen:
Shut down the Ubuntu VM (13.10)
In Parallels 9 config for the VM, go to Hardware > Video, and disable 3D acceleration.
Restart Ubuntu 13.10. You will now get a completely black screen.
Shut down the Ubuntu VM once more.
Again, in Parallels config for the VM, go to Hardware > Video and reenable 3D acceleration.
Restart, and you're back in business (No black screen and everything properly updated).

o Better parsing of QChem files and data 
  - MOs printed with PRINT_ORBITALS
  - Energy values
  - @@@ Job handling (different Molecule Layers ?)

o Don't let openbabel at files it can't handle.

o Better parsing of Fchk files
  - Geometry optimisation handling
  - ECP handling

o Better concept of Conformer and how they are handled (links to the reaction
  pathway animation).  Choice of default conformer.

Data Layers have embedded Data objects, they do not take ownership of the objects as
they reside in the Bank associated with the Layer::Molecule .

Configurators take a reference to the associated Layer as they operate on it rather
than own it.

Layer directory contains layers that have been updated to use Data namespace objects

Remove the Data::Grid constructor that relies on function evaluation
  - a new GridEvaluator class should be created that sends out progress signals 
    and can be threaded

Initializing a repository:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/nutjunkie/IQmol.git
git push -u origin master

IQmol is located at https://github.com/nutjunkie/IQmol


Push an existing repository:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a list of the file changes, do
#> git status 

The following will add a directory, recursively
#> git add dir

Add the new files to the index
git add .

Then commit to the local repo:
git commit -a -m 'message'

Tag if required:
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m 'message'

Then push
git push
git push --tags

o Clear out any unused shaders
o Deactivate the Effects tab for the ShaderDialog class (until working);

1) run macdeployqt on IQmol.app
4) Check libQGLViewer
5) install database!

Distribution Version: OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure the code has been compiled with the -O2 swich and run run the
macdeployqt (distrubuted with Qt) command on the application bundle:

Make sure symmol.o has been compiled with debugging symbols, this 
gfortran -g -c symmol.f90

#> macdeployqt IQmol.app

Check the libraries have been linked to the local copies by running the
following:

#> otool -L IQmol.app/Contents/MacOS/IQmol


Note the macdeployqt command has created a local copy of the OpenBabel library
(last line above), which is no good as libopenbabel hard links to force-field
parameter files which are in /usr/local/share which won't be there unless the
user has installed OpenBabel separately.  For this reason OpenBabel is a
dependency and we can remove the local copy of the library and point to the
system one using the following:

#> install_name_tool -change @executable_path/../Frameworks/libopenbabel.4.dylib /usr/local/lib/libopenbabel.4.dylib IQmol.app/Contents/MacOS/IQmol

The output from running otool on the IQmol should now contain 
    ....
	/usr/local/lib/libopenbabel.4.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)

Thank you! I've had the exact same thing happening. Try to Save As from IE,
Chrome, or FF and it crashes. Trying to save from Word, same thing. I updated
the Network visibility and the problem vanished immediately. Here's what I did:

Open the Network and Sharing Center. On the left side click on Change advanced
sharing settings. Click on Home or Work and then select T*urn off network
discovery*. Save it and close. That's it.

Question: What location on the HDD is the dialog trying to open? If the dialog
is trying to open to a default locationthat does not exist, it could crash. If
the exception is not handled [the creation of such a dialog typically isnt],
then it could crash/lockup the application in question.

The instructions for libcrypt need to be executed again

setenv CPPFLAGS -I`pwd`

ln -sf /path/to/libgpg-error/src/.libs/libgpg-error.a .
ln -sf /path/to/libgpg-error/src/gpg-error.h .

./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/Network/Servers/dingo.anu.edu.au/Volumes/NAS/homes/agilbert/Development/extlib --with-libgcrypt --with-libgcrypt-prefix=dummy --with-libz

makes the library, but fails on the examples.

with openssl:
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/Network/Servers/dingo.anu.edu.au/Volumes/NAS/homes/agilbert/Development/extlib --with-openssl --with-libssl-prefix=/Network/Servers/dingo.anu.edu.au/Volumes/NAS/homes/agilbert/Development/extlib/ --without-libgcrypt --with-libz


libgpg-error:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This compiled without any problems as follows:

./configure --enable-static --prefix=/Network/Servers/dingo.anu.edu.au/Volumes/NAS/homes/agilbert/Development/extlib
make
make install


libgcrypt:
~~~~~~~~~
The --with-gpg-error-prefix seems not to work as expected. I used following
method after looking in the configure file (assuming libgpg-error is a
subdirectory in current dir):


setenv GPG_ERROR_CONFIG /path/to/libgpg-error/src/gpg-error-config
setenv CPPFLAGS -I`pwd`
setenv LDFLAGS -L`pwd`
ln -sf /path/to/libgpg-error/src/.libs/libgpg-error.a .
ln -sf /path/to/libgpg-error/src/gpg-error.h .

In current dir (`pwd`) now are the links to the .a file and the .h file of
gpg-error, thats why the include paths point to this.  The following then built
libgcrypt:

./configure --enable-static --prefix=/Network/Servers/dingo.anu.edu.au/Volumes/NAS/homes/agilbert/Development/extlib --with-gpg-error-prefix=dummy
make
make install
